# Netflix-Clone-ProgrammaticUI
  Netflix Clone is an app which users can see trending movies, trending tv, popular, and upcoming movies. They can slide within these categories horizontally and when they click the poster of the film, the trailer of the film is opened. Actually, there are four categories, home, upcoming, top search, and download. Trending movies, trending tv, popular, and upcoming movies categories are in home section. Furthermore, they can see upcoming films in upcoming category and when they tapped the poster of the film, the trailer of the film is opened just like in home section. Moreover, In Search section, they can seaerch different films and see their posters. Likewise, they can watch the trailer of the film by tapping the poster of it. Also, they can see downloaded films which the users download in home section by tapping long to the poster of the film in this category. They can also delete these downloaded films. In that sense, I used CoreData to save and to delete the downloaded films. Finally, when the users terminated the app and reopened it, the big poster in home section is changed automatically. 
  I built the app with MVVM architectural design and benefited from Movie API and Youtube API. In addition, I used CollectiveView and created each element of the app from scratch. I also benefited from SF Symbols to make symbols good look. Moreover, I used SDWebImage to show posters of the film and to create desirable UI.
